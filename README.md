After 20 years in sales, I’m pivoting into the world of data—where I get to turn business problems into data problems and uncover insights. This GitHub is my space to build, experiment, and share projects as I continue developing my skills in SQL, Python, and data visualization.

I’ll be adding portfolio projects, personal explorations, and anything else I find interesting along the way.
